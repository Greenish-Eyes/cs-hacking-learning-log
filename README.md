# Step 1 Reflection: Git & Python Foundations

**By:** Olena Fedochynska
**Week Ending:** \[Insert Date]

---

## What I Accomplished:

* Installed and configured Git on my machine.
* Set up my global Git user name and email.
* Learned core Git commands: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`.
* Created and pushed my first test repository to GitHub.
* Configured my default branch to be `main`.
* Installed Python and began practicing basic syntax.
* Wrote small scripts using variables, input/output, conditionals, and loops.
* Started organizing my GitHub profile and added README files to my repos.

---

## What I Learned:

* **Version control** is essential for tracking progress and collaborating — Git helps me store and manage my code like a professional.
* **Pushing code to GitHub** feels empowering and gives me a real sense of progress.
* **Python is beginner-friendly**, but I need to keep practicing functions, lists, and loops to feel fully confident.
* **Daily practice and small wins** are better than waiting to “master” everything at once.

---

## Challenges I Faced:

* At first, I wasn’t sure how to connect local Git repositories with GitHub.
* Remembering Git command syntax without copying it every time was tricky.
* Understanding the difference between staging, committing, and pushing took some repetition.

## 🗺What’s Next (Step 2 Plan):

> Focus: Build foundational CS + Ethical Hacking projects

### Step 2 Goals:

* ✅ Build a **Password Cracker** using Python and a wordlist.
* ✅ Create a **Port Scanner** to understand networking basics.
* 🗂 Start a new GitHub repo for these projects: `cs-tools`
* 📓 Document each project with a full README (goal, code, features, what I learned).
* 📸 Add screenshots of output or short demo GIFs (if possible).
* 🎯 Try 1 beginner CTF room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) and write my first *CTF write-up*.
* 🎥 Watch 2 YouTube tutorials on Python + hacking tools.
