# 🧠 Password Cracker in Python

## 🔍 Overview
This is a basic password cracker that takes an MD5 hash and tries to crack it using a wordlist (dictionary attack).

## 💡 What I Learned
- How hashing algorithms work (MD5, later changed to SHA256)
- How to read files line by line
- How to compare hashes in Python

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Add words to `wordlist.txt`
2. Get an MD5 hash from any word
3. Run the script and paste the hash

```bash
python main.py
